title: "Collected consciousness: AI product design for empowering human creativity"
description: "I wrote this! It’s a culmination of lessons I’ve learned over the
  last few years asking questions and building off existing research surrounding
  how creativity works, how people “do” creativity, the needs they have when
  they do creative things, what tools actually help us through creative work,
  and what tools don’t. "

AI is a controversial topic in creativity for a lot of really legitimate reasons, and I think this essay came out of a curiosity for learning about and articulating exactly what those reasons are and why it feels gross to use AI in the way we’re seeing it shoved into creative domains today. 

It covers what AI cannot do in creativity, where it might be able to help support us, and how we as designers might build better products that employ AI as a means to make us more creative and thoughtful human beings, and challenge us, instead of merely attempting to automate the process. 

It’s still contains a lot of early and exploratory ideas, but I’d love to hear your thoughts around this.
