    content: '"Mental skills include analysis and reasoning, posing and researching
      questions, critical skills, language-based skills— writing and
      speaking—and all the covert cognitive skills that have been built on
      experience, and which we associate with instinct and intuition."'

    content: '"Skills associated with the hand things, both material and digital.
      Skills associated with making are also associated with specific tools.
      Different tools allow for the different types of exploration. But the more
      one works with diverse tools and diverse techniques—two-dimension- ally,
      three-dimensionally, in diagram or sketch form, rough or polished—and the
      more tacitly one selects from among the tools and techniques available,
      the more open and exploratory the design process."'
