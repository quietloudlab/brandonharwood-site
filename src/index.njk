  <h1>Brandon Harwood is trying something new.</h1>
  <p>This is a personal website - separate from my professional one that's way too serious, and separate from social media, because I mean, I'm tired of posting things into spaces that just shove it in front of people's faces. I want something where I can shout into the void and if people want to see it, they can go out of their way to see it.</p>

        <li>
          <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a> - {{ post.page.date | date("yyyy-MM-dd") }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}

    <p>No posts yet! Add some content to your blog.</p>
