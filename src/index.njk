<h1>Brandon Harwood is trying something old.</h1>

<p>This is a personal website - separate from my professional one that's way too serious, and separate from social media, because I mean, I'm tired of posting things into spaces that just shove it in front of people's faces. I want something where I can shout into the void and if people want to see it, they can go out of their way to see it.</p>

{% if collections.posts.length > 0 %}
  <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in collections.posts | slice(0, 5) %}
      <li class="post-item">
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a>
        <time datetime="{{ post.date | dateIso }}">{{ post.date | dateReadable }}</time>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  
  {% if collections.posts.length > 5 %}
    <p><a href="/blog/">View all posts</a></p>
